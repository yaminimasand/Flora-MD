This repository houses a robust implementation of plant disease detection leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture developed from scratch. Alongside the CNN model, a user-friendly web application has been crafted, enabling users to effortlessly upload images of plants. Upon submission, the CNN model swiftly classifies the plant's health status, distinguishing between a healthy state and instances of powdery mildew or rust infestation.

Notably, this application offers comprehensive language support, accommodating users from diverse linguistic backgrounds by providing translations in all Indian regional languages. Furthermore, the platform boasts additional features, including an interactive chatbot, a curated news section, and practical solutions for identified plant diseases. Users can also access links to purchase relevant products, enhancing their ability to address plant health issues effectively.

Coupled with its elegant and intuitive user interface design, this application seamlessly blends aesthetics with functionality, ensuring an enriching user experience.
